(Paste these into the big box on the left side of the screen.)

## 6) Click on "Create Question Bank" 
\- Found near the bottom of the conversion program window.  
\- You will be asked by using the file manager application to select where you want to save the output file.  
\- You will now have a Question Bank file (a .zip file) that can be imported to Blackboard or Moodle. If you are importing the test questions into Moodle, specify that your file is in Blackboard format.

The testbank will be in Blackboard format, so you may need to select that option when you import it into Moodle (or whichever Learning Management System you use).  

## Font: 
To change the font size displayed in the conversion program press a digit key (1 through 9) while holding the Ctrl key on your keyboard.
