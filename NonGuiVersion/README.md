- With a filename that begins with the word “convert” followed by a space: e.g., “convert test1.txt”  
  
### 4) Using the Windows File Explorer, navigate to and double click on the conversion program
If the conversion program finds errors in your input file, exit the program and correct the errors before trying again (e.g., a question with no answers provided or a question with an asterisk beside two different answers).  
  
### 5) The program will change the first word of the .txt filename to “converted”.  
  
### 6) In that same folder, you will now have a Question Bank file (a .zip file) that can be imported to Blackboard or Moodle. If you are importing the test questions into Moodle, specify that your file is in Blackboard format.
